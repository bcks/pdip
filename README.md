#Police Department IP Address Ranges

Inspired by [Kelly Weill](https://twitter.com/KELLYWEILL)'s article on [New York City Police Department edits to Wikipedia](http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/03/8563947/edits-wikipedia-pages-bell-garner-diallo-traced-1-police-plaza) and [Ed Summer](http://inkdroid.org/ehs/)'s [anon](https://github.com/edsu/anon) tool for tweeting anonymous edits to Wikipedia, I started [NYPDedits](https://twitter.com/NYPDedits), a bot that tweets edits from the IP address range of the New York City Police Department.

At journalism professor [Andrew Lih](http://www.andrewlih.com/Welcome.html)'s suggestion, I started this list of IP address ranges of other police departments so others may do the same.
